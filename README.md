# Exodus: A Modpack for KSP

Are you ready? For the hardest challenge you will ever face in running the Kerbal Space Agency (KSA)? Kerbin is doomed. There's nothing you or anyone can do to save it. But you can save the Kerbal race. It's time to race the doom clock. It's up to you to establish self-sustaining orbital & surface stations on every sufficiently large body in the system.

Exodus is intended to be a semi-realistic/immersive modpack with clear goals and a high difficulty. You are promoted to command of KSA at the beginning of a worst-case-scenario regarding an NKO (near kerbin object) that is simply not going to miss this time, and are given the task of rescuing the Kerbal race with orbital stations & surface bases.

Due to the preferences of certain mod authors, rather than a single download as a Minecraft modpack may have, this will be provided as a list of CKAN mods with my own necessary mods at the end.

## Mod List: Tentative & Incomplete!

Note that this list will not be including dependencies. I expect that you will be using CKAN, and that dependencies will install automatically.

* [x] Science
* Active Texture Management - Agressive
* Audio Muffler
* AmpYear
* Better Burn Time
* Box Sat & Box Sat Prototype Parts
* Chatterer
* Community Tech Tree
* Connected Living Space
* Contract Configurator
* Crowd Sourced Science
* EVA Parachutes
* Final Frontier
* Kerbal Alarm Clock
* Landing Height Display
* MechJeb 2
* Outer Planets Mod
* RealChute Parachute Systems
* Remote Tech
* Sensible Screenshot
* SpaceY Heavy Lifters + Expansion
* Stockalike Station Parts Expansion
* Surface Mounted Lights
* USI Asteroid Recycling Technologies
* USI Exploration Pack
* USI Freight Transport Technologies
* USI Kolonization Systems (MKS/OKS)
* USI Life Support
* USI Survival Pack
* USI Tools

### Required but not yet implemented Mods

These are mods and/or concepts that will be fulfilled by later versions of the modpack.

* StockNoContracts
* Some way to move the KSC to another location (most likely orbit of Kerbin) in the mid/late game
* Some way to make launch clamps mandatory
* Custom tech tree
* The Exodus Contract Pack (WIP)
* Implementation of MechJeb2 early in the tech tree because I'm not jadedcat

### KNOWN BUGS

Note that you should check and see that any bugs are caused by a combination of bugs within the modpack. I am not the author of the grand majority of mods in Exodus, and further I am not a developer or modder. I'm a writer, dammit. I can't provide any kind of support for single-mod bugs.

No bugs yet reported

## How you (yes, you!) can help

If you wish to help in any of these ways, please post in this thread.

### Needed Mods

Please feel free to suggest mods to fulfill concepts in the second list ("Required but not...") or other ways in which I can fulfill those concepts. Also feel free to suggest any mod for any reason, but please list that reason!

### Testing the pack

This is actually important. I don't have a room full of machines with different hardware. I can't even guess if the modpack will run on X hardware unless it happens to be my hardware, or someone tests it for me.

### Suggestions & Critiques

I can't improve the pack unless I get feedback. Please, feel free to reply to this post with your thoughts. I am willing to discuss any aspect of the modpack. :)

### KSA Logos

I need logos for the KSA. The sizes I need are 256x160 and 60x40.

I'd also appreciate an upscaled image including the KSA logo but also the title for a "modpack logo."

### Contract Configurator

Am I alone in thinking that the contract configurator documentation & tutorials are less than perfectly useful? If not, then any one of you with experience (in Contract Configurator, of course) willing to show me how to do some certain more complex things would be appreciated.

### Doublecheck my work

I have uploaded the files for the WIP Exodus contract pack to GitHub. It's uploaded under the MIT license, which I felt was most appropriate for this project.

If you are willing, and familiar with (or willing to familiarize yourself) the kinds of .CFG files and syntax that Contract Configurator requires, please feel free to go there. I would love feedback on any aspect of my code. You can find the documentation here: [Contract Configurator Documentation](https://github.com/jrossignol/ContractConfigurator/wiki)

### Getting The Word Out

When Exodus is at a release, and if you enjoy it, I'd love it if you'd get the word out however you can. When we're at release, I will be working on making the modpack more publicly available, also, so you won't have to send people here.
