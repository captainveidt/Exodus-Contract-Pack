	// Not sure that this will work. The intent is to pull a planet (or moon, I'm not picky -- but it can't be the system's sun or Kerbol) and define it as the variable listed above starting in the description field. 
	// I do know that it can't be too random. Just for an easy example, a mission to Duna before the missions to Mun or Minmus would be potentially disastrous in terms of failing the player without cause.
