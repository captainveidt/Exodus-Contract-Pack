	description = [KSA Tracking Station Dept.] Administrator - We have a plan. We're calling it "The Exodus Plan." Unfortunately that space rock we had you confirm for us is too large and too dense for us to redirect or destroy. So we had to start thinking out of the box. All of us are going to live in space. First, we need a space station & colony in orbit of Kerbin. This station will act as both a proof of concept and a mission setup point, so that we can send up the individual assemblies for later missions individually.
	
	synopsis = Put a space station into orbit of Kerbin. It needs to be sef-sustaining and to have at least 3 unused docking ports, and a permanent crew of 1 pilot, 1 scientist, and 1 engineer. 
	
	completedMessage = Thank you, Administrator. The people's hope lies in you from this point on.
